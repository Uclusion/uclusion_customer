# Why Uclusion is free forever for open source collaborators

As you can see from [our blog](https://medium.com/uclusion) Uclusion uses a lot of open source software. We have not had much time to make contributions while boot strapping our startup. So the free forever policy is our way of giving back. However many times charitable Silicon Valley founders are accused of giving only what they think others need. I definitely don't want to waste the precious time of open source developers so I just now Googled "open source asynchronous organization".

The first hit is [Asynchronous decision-making: Helping remote teams succeed](https://opensource.com/article/17/12/asynchronous-decision-making) written by Bertrand Delacretaz Apache Software Foundation Member and Director, Principal Scientist, Adobe Digital Experience group. Seems reputable enough and although both of Uclusion's founders are from Adobe, I've never come in contact with Bertrand or this article before searching just now.

I wish I had though because Bertrand lays out the principles on which Uclusion was built in a way that I've struggled to:

## Required tools - Central asynchronous communications channel

Uclusion calls this a workspace. You can see screen shots of example usage on our [home page](https://www.uclusion.com). The only difference is that where Bertrand describes a very general communication tool or even worst case having to use email, Uclusion workspaces are specifically built around deciding on requirements, proposing and getting approval for stories and tracking progress at a glance.

## Required tools - Consensus-building mechanism

Uclusion offers two mechanisms - Dialogs and Initiatives. Dialogs allow you to propose and vote certainty on a number of alternatives at once. Initiatives are for an up down vote on one idea.

## Required tools - Case management system

Uclusion is not trying to replace issue trackers and we use Github boards ourselves. However we do distinguish between issues and stories. An issue should be something that has to be fixed - just a matter of when. Also the implementation of an issue should be fairly straight forward. That is to say an issue should not require a lot of collaboration or its a story. 

For stories Uclusion has a built in workflow. If you are not ready to do the story yet then edit the workspace description with the new potential requirement. Everyone else will be alerted and automatically see a diff. When you are ready to do the story you can create it and everyone will automatically be notified to vote on whether or not you should do it. If you are uncertain of implementation you can create a dialog within the story.

Then Bertrand says
>The nine members of ASF's board of directors make a few dozen decisions at each monthly phone meeting, which last less than two hours. We carefully prepare for these meetings by making most of our decisions asynchronously in advance. This allows us to focus the meeting on the complex or uncertain issues rather than the ones that already have full or partial consensus.

That's exactly how Uclusion operates using our own software except that since we are a startup founders meet more often than monthly. But Uclusion also has contractors working for us and we reach complex decisions with them almost completely online inside our software.

So in conclusion we really think Uclusion would be ideal for open source collaborators and hope that offering it free forever to them can in some small way make open source development more fun and popular. You can sign up for free [here](https://production.uclusion.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=freeforever#signUp). Then if you decide you like it just create an issue with label requestfree in this repo explaining you are using Uclusion for open source purposes.
